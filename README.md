# Angular Basics ‚Äì Learning Journal ‚ù§Ô∏è

Welcome! This repository contains a project I developed while studying Angular through the **Angular Basics course from Simplilearn**. It represents a hands-on learning journey focusing on **Angular Forms**, **Services**, and other core concepts of the framework.

## üöÄ About the Project

This Angular project demonstrates how to create a user registration form using **Template-Driven Forms**, including data validation and submission logic.

The form allows:

- Capturing and validating user data
- Real-time feedback with error messages
- Integration with a `submit()` function

Additionally, I learned how to:

- Create and register **components**
- Import essential modules like `FormsModule`
- Create and use **Angular Services** with `@Injectable`

Then open http://localhost:4200 in your browser.

## Useful Commands
ng new democomponents ‚Äì Creates a new Angular project

Make sure to import FormsModule in the @Component or @NgModule where you're using ngModel.
When displaying validation errors, use ?.['errorName'] to avoid compiler warnings.
